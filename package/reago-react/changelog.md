# reago-react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c4135fc: Added new `useAtom` and `useDeasyncAtom` hooks for querying

  We now offer three ways of accessing atoms:

  - `useAtom` - returns raw atom value as is, giving consumers full control over async operations.
  - `useAsyncAtom` - returns atom value via Suspense, Promises are handled automatically.
  - `useDeasyncAtom` - returns atom value unpacked via `deasync`, useful for environments with no Suspense support.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9e95f80: Renamed suspense-based `useAtom` to `useAsyncAtom`

  With plenty of legacy projects in the wild the assumption that everyone can use the suspense-based
  `useAtom` in `reago-react` is overly optimistic. This name change will allow us to introduce two
  new ways of querying - for raw and deasync values.
