# reago-react

React bindings for the `reago` state manager.


## What is Reago?

A state management library, named after the Esperanto word for 'reaction'.

Why Esperanto? Because it's the language of connection, designed to bring together people
from different backgrounds. And just like that, Reago is here to connect your app's states
with clarity and ease.
